# EXPERIMENT 2: BOOLEAN FUNCTION IMPLEMENTAION

# AIM:

To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.

F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D 

F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy

# EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher

# THEORY
Implementing Boolean functions in Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language)
involves translating the simplified Boolean expressions into Verilog code to describe
the behavior of digital circuits. The basic building blocks in Verilog is module. The
module represent a combinational circuit. Use logical operators (&, |, ~, ^) to
implement Boolean functions directly. Use built-in gate primitives for basic functions.
Use University program VWF to verify the functionality of your Verilog modules.
Create waveform and check outputs against expected results.


# PROCEDURE

1.	Type the program in Quartus software.

2.	Compile and run the program.

3.	Generate the RTL schematic and save the logic diagram.

4.	Create nodes for inputs and outputs to generate the timing diagram.

5.	For different input combinations generate the timing diagram.
